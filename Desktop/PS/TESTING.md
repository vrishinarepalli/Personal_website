4. When opponent sends out a Pokemon, you should see the prediction overlay appear!

## What to Look For

### Initial Prediction (Turn 1)
- ✅ Overlay slides in from the right
- ✅ Shows Pokemon name at top
- ✅ Shows confidence percentage (usually ~20-30%)
- ✅ Lists top 3 abilities with percentages
- ✅ Lists top 3 items with percentages
- ✅ Lists top 5-6 predicted moves

### After First Move (Turn 2-3)
- ✅ "Known Moves" section appears with checkmark
- ✅ Move appears in confirmed (green) section
- ✅ Remaining moves update in "Predicted Moves"
- ✅ Confidence increases slightly

### After Second Move (Turn 4-5)
- ✅ **Choice items get ruled out** (if 2 different moves used)
- ✅ **Assault Vest ruled out** (if status move like Swords Dance)
- ✅ "Ruled out" section appears (red) showing eliminated items
- ✅ Item probabilities redistribute
- ✅ Confidence jumps to ~45-50%

### Console Logs to Check

Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```

✓ On Pokemon Showdown, initializing...
✓ Predictor initialized

```

Then during battle:
```

⚠️ Ruled out Assault Vest (status move: Swords Dance)
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Overlay doesn't appear
**Check:**
1. Are you in an actual battle? (not team builder)
2. Did opponent send out a Pokemon?
3. Console errors?

**Fix:**
- Reload the page (F5)
- Check if smogon_data.js exists and is not empty
- Make sure you ran `python convert_data_to_js.py`

### "SMOGON_DATA is not defined" error
**Fix:**
```bash
python convert_data_to_js.py
# Then reload extension in chrome://extensions/
```

### Predictions seem random
**Check:**
- Is the Pokemon in the OU tier?
- Are you testing with popular Pokemon (Kingambit, Great Tusk, etc.)?

**Note:** Uncommon Pokemon have less data, so predictions will be less confident.

### Overlay is too large/small
**Fix:** Edit `extension/content/overlay.css`
```css
#ps-set-predictor-overlay {
    width: 320px;  /* Change this value */
}
```

}
```

## Performance Testing
