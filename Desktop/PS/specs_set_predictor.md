# Pokemon Showdown Set Predictor - Project Specifications

## Project Overview
A Chrome extension that predicts opponent Pokemon sets in real-time during Pokemon Showdown battles. Uses Smogon usage statistics as a baseline and learns from battle history to provide increasingly accurate predictions.

## Core Concept
During a battle, as information is revealed (moves used, ability shown, item held, damage calculations), the system narrows down the possible sets and provides probability-weighted predictions for:
- **Remaining Moves**: What moves the opponent likely has
- **Item**: What item they're holding (if not revealed)
- **Ability**: What ability they have (if not revealed)
- **EV Spread**: Likely stat distribution
- **Tera Type**: What they might Terastallize into (Gen 9)

## Use Case Example
```
Turn 1: Opponent sends out Kingambit
├─ Initial Prediction (from Smogon data):
│  ├─ 95% Supreme Overlord ability
│  ├─ 50% Leftovers, 21% Black Glasses
│  ├─ 99% Sucker Punch, 91% Swords Dance, 88% Kowtow Cleave
│  └─ Most common: Adamant 0/252/4/0/0/252

Turn 3: Kingambit uses Sucker Punch
├─ Update: Sucker Punch confirmed
└─ Recalculate: Still likely Swords Dance + Kowtow Cleave + Iron Head

Turn 5: Kingambit takes damage, survives with more HP than expected
├─ Damage calc suggests: Leftovers or high HP investment
└─ Update item probability: 75% Leftovers

Turn 7: Kingambit uses Swords Dance
└─ Confirmed moves: Sucker Punch, Swords Dance
    Predicted 4th move: 90% Kowtow Cleave, 80% Iron Head (one of these)
```

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Layer
**What We Already Have:**
- ✓ Smogon usage statistics (abilities, items, moves, spreads)
- ✓ 407 Pokemon with detailed moveset data
- ✓ Usage percentages for all components

**What We Need:**
- Battle history database (user's past battles)
- Set matching algorithm
- Bayesian inference engine

### 2. Prediction Engine

#### 2.1 Initial Prediction (Turn 1)
When opponent sends out a Pokemon:
```python
initial_state = {
    "pokemon": "Kingambit",
    "known_moves": [],
    "known_ability": None,
    "known_item": None,
    "predictions": {
        "ability": {"Supreme Overlord": 0.96, "Defiant": 0.04},
        "item": {"Leftovers": 0.50, "Black Glasses": 0.21, ...},
        "moves": {
            "Sucker Punch": 0.99,
            "Swords Dance": 0.91,
            "Kowtow Cleave": 0.88,
            "Iron Head": 0.81,
            ...
        },
        "spreads": {
            "Adamant:0/252/4/0/0/252": 0.16,
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2.2 Bayesian Update Algorithm
As information is revealed, update probabilities:

**When a move is used:**
```python
# Move is confirmed, probability becomes 1.0
confirmed_moves.add(move_name)

# Update set probabilities based on move correlations
# Example: If Sucker Punch is used, Swords Dance becomes more likely
# (because they're often used together)
```

**When ability is revealed:**
```python
# Ability confirmed
known_ability = ability_name

# Filter out sets that don't have this ability
# Recalculate move probabilities for this specific ability variant
```

**When item is revealed:**
```python
# Item confirmed
known_item = item_name

# Update move correlations
# Example: Choice Scarf → offensive moves more likely
```

**Damage calculation hints:**
```python
# If Pokemon survives/dies from expected damage:
# - Estimate EV investment (bulk vs speed vs offense)
# - Update spread predictions
# - Update item predictions (Leftovers, Assault Vest, etc.)
```

#### 2.3 Set Correlation Matrix
Build correlation data from Smogon usage:
```python
correlations = {
    "Kingambit": {
        "Sucker Punch + Swords Dance": 0.85,  # Often paired
        "Leftovers + Iron Head": 0.60,
        "Choice Scarf + Low Kick": 0.40,
        ...
    }
}
```

### 3. Learning System

#### 3.1 Battle History Storage
```json
{
  "battle_id": "gen9ou-12345",
  "date": "2025-10-27",
  "opponent": "username",
  "pokemon_seen": [
    {
      "species": "Kingambit",
      "ability": "Supreme Overlord",
      "item": "Leftovers",
      "moves": ["Sucker Punch", "Swords Dance", "Kowtow Cleave", "Iron Head"],
      "tera_type": "Ghost",
      "revealed_turn": {
        "ability": 1,
        "moves": [3, 5, 7, 12],
        "item": 8,
        "tera_type": 15
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3.2 Personalized Learning
- Track opponent patterns (if you face same players)
- Learn meta-specific trends (ladder rating range)
- Adapt to tier shifts faster than monthly Smogon updates

## Prediction Algorithm Details

### Bayesian Inference Formula
```
P(Set|Evidence) = P(Evidence|Set) × P(Set) / P(Evidence)

Where:
- P(Set) = Prior probability (from Smogon usage)
- P(Evidence|Set) = Likelihood (how likely is this evidence given this set)
- P(Set|Evidence) = Posterior probability (updated prediction)
```

### Example Calculation
```python
# Initial: Kingambit sent out
priors = {
    "Set A (SD Sweeper)": 0.60,  # Swords Dance, Sucker Punch, Kowtow, Iron Head
    "Set B (Boots Pivot)": 0.25,  # Sucker Punch, Iron Head, Knock Off, Low Kick
    "Set C (Scarf)": 0.15         # Sucker Punch, Low Kick, Iron Head, Kowtow
}

# Evidence: Used Swords Dance
likelihoods = {
    "Set A": 1.0,   # Has Swords Dance
    "Set B": 0.0,   # Doesn't have Swords Dance
    "Set C": 0.0    # Doesn't have Swords Dance
}

# Update
posteriors = {
    "Set A": 1.0,   # Only possible set
    "Set B": 0.0,
    "Set C": 0.0
}

# Therefore: Likely has Sucker Punch, Kowtow Cleave, Iron Head
```
